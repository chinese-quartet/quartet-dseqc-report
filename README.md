# MultiReport for Quartet DNA-Seq Pipeline

### Usage

To use this code, you need to install MultiQC and then your code. For example:

```bash
pip install MultiQC
python setup.py install
```

Use `python setup.py develop` if you're actively working on the code - then you don't need to rerun the installation every time you make an edit _(though you still do if you change anything in `setup.py`)_.
